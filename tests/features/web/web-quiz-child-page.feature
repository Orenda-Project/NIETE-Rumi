Feature: Web child quiz page on the portal
  A child opens the quiz link the teacher forwarded and plays it on a web page,
  in WhatsApp's in-app browser or the phone's own browser.

  Background:
    Given a quiz share code "AB12CD" that is active

  Scenario: The link opens the quiz page with a link preview
    When the link "/q/AB12CD" is opened
    Then the page carries the quiz as boot data
    And the page has og:title, og:description and og:image tags
    And the page is marked noindex and no-cache

  Scenario: A new child plays to the class league table
    Given a phone that has never played
    When the child taps "Play", then "I'm new", and types a first name
    And answers all 5 questions, one of them wrong
    And fixes the tricky one with Jugnu
    Then the child sees "You got 4 out of 5" with 4 stars
    And the scorecard shows the first name, the topic, 4/5 and 4 stars
    And the class league table highlights the child's own row as "YOU"

  Scenario: A returning child is remembered on this phone
    Given a child finished a quiz on this phone before
    When the link of a new quiz is opened
    Then the landing offers "Play as <first name>" in one tap

  Scenario: A reload mid-quiz resumes
    Given a child answered 3 of 5 questions
    When the page is reloaded
    Then the landing offers "Continue 4/5" and the saved answers are kept

  Scenario: A typed name that matches a class name asks "Is this you?"
    When a child types a first name that is already on the class list
    Then the page asks "Are you <name>?" before starting

  Scenario: A closed quiz explains itself in the quiz language
    Given the share code has expired
    When the link is opened
    Then a friendly "This quiz has closed" page shows in the quiz language with status 410

  Scenario: Sharing works when the browser has no share menu
    Given the browser has no navigator.share
    When the child taps "Share to class group"
    Then the page offers "Open WhatsApp with the message" and "Copy the message"

  Scenario: A recorded clip that cannot play falls back to the phone's voice
    Given a question whose recorded clip fails to load
    When the question is shown
    Then the question is read by the phone's own voice
    And an "audio_fallback" event is logged with the reason

  Scenario: The landing names the teacher and the class as the teacher's own texts do
    Given the teacher's stored name is "Example Teacher" and finished children typed class "3"
    When the link is opened
    Then the landing says "From Teacher Example Teacher · Class 3"
    And the class page link preview names "Class 3"
    But before anyone has finished, the landing shows no class

  Scenario: A quick tap never brings back the old line
    Given a question whose recorded clip has not started yet
    When the child taps an answer at once
    Then the feedback is read and the old question is not read again
    And no "audio_fallback" event is logged for the stopped clip

  Scenario: A child remembered on this phone is listed once
    Given a child played the teacher's earlier quiz on this phone
    When the child plays the teacher's next quiz with "Play as <first name>"
    Then "Whose turn?" lists the child's name once

  Scenario: The teacher's report counts the first finish of a web quiz
    Given a child played the quiz on the web page
    And finished it once and then again on another phone
    When the teacher's report is written
    Then the report shows the first finished score, as the league table does

  Scenario: The answer buttons come in the same order as the WhatsApp quiz and the teacher's answer key
    Given a question whose options were shuffled when the quiz was made
    When the question is shown on the page
    Then the buttons are in that same shuffled order
    And tapping the right answer is marked right, and each wrong answer gets its own feedback

  Scenario: A figure question shows the drawing, not the WhatsApp card
    Given a question whose WhatsApp card paints the stem and options into a picture
    And the question carries a fraction bar figure
    When the quiz is opened on the web page
    Then the question shows the fraction bar drawn as a picture with no question text inside it
    And the stem and the options are shown once, as text
    And the read-aloud says "Look at the bars." before the question

  Scenario: A question with long options shows no picture at all
    Given a question that WhatsApp sends as a card only because its options are long
    When the quiz is opened on the web page
    Then the question shows no picture
    And the stem and the options are shown as text

  Scenario: Picture options are drawings, never emoji
    Given a picture question whose options are an apple, a cat and a bus
    When the quiz is opened on the web page
    Then each option shows its drawing with its word under it
