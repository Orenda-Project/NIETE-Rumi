Feature: Web child quiz page on the portal
  A child opens the quiz link the teacher forwarded and plays it on a web page,
  in WhatsApp's in-app browser or the phone's own browser.

  Background:
    Given a quiz share code "AB12CD" that is active

  Scenario: The link opens the quiz page with a link preview
    When the link "/q/AB12CD" is opened
    Then the page carries the quiz as boot data
    And the page has og:title, og:description and og:image tags
    And the page is marked noindex and no-cache

  Scenario: A new child plays to the class league table
    Given a phone that has never played
    When the child taps "Play", then "I'm new", and types a first name
    And answers all 5 questions, one of them wrong
    And fixes the tricky one with Jugnu
    Then the child sees "You got 4 out of 5" with 4 stars
    And the scorecard shows the first name, the topic, 4/5 and 4 stars
    And the class league table highlights the child's own row as "YOU"

  Scenario: A returning child is remembered on this phone
    Given a child finished a quiz on this phone before
    When the link of a new quiz is opened
    Then the landing offers "Play as <first name>" in one tap

  Scenario: A reload mid-quiz resumes
    Given a child answered 3 of 5 questions
    When the page is reloaded
    Then the landing offers "Continue 4/5" and the saved answers are kept

  Scenario: A typed name that matches a class name asks "Is this you?"
    When a child types a first name that is already on the class list
    Then the page asks "Are you <name>?" before starting

  Scenario: A closed quiz explains itself in the quiz language
    Given the share code has expired
    When the link is opened
    Then a friendly "This quiz has closed" page shows in the quiz language with status 410

  Scenario: Sharing works when the browser has no share menu
    Given the browser has no navigator.share
    When the child taps "Share to class group"
    Then the page offers "Open WhatsApp with the message" and "Copy the message"

  Scenario: A recorded clip that cannot play falls back to the phone's voice
    Given a question whose recorded clip fails to load
    When the question is shown
    Then the question is read by the phone's own voice
    And an "audio_fallback" event is logged with the reason
